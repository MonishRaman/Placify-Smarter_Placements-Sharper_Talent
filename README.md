- 🎯 **Subjectivity:** Human evaluation varies widely.
- ❌ **Lack of Feedback:** Students often get no insights post-interview.
- 📉 **No Data:** Institutions miss critical improvement metrics.

**Result?** Talented students go unnoticed, companies lose time and resources, and placement records fall short.

## 🔐 Password Policy (Important)

As of Oct 2025 we updated password strength enforcement to improve user experience for legacy accounts:

- Strong password rules (min 8 chars, upper, lower, number, special) are enforced ONLY for:
  - New registrations
  - Password reset / change flows
- Login no longer blocks users with older (weaker) passwords that were valid when created.
- During login, a non-blocking advisory appears (and an additional toast after successful sign in) if the entered password is weak, encouraging an update for better security.

Why this change? Some early users were locked out after we introduced stricter rules. This adjustment preserves security for new/updated credentials while maintaining backward compatibility.

Planned enhancement: A settings page flow to proactively prompt weak-password users to upgrade their credentials.
